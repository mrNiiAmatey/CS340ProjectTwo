This repository provides a Python-based web application that manages animal data, enabling Grazioso Salvare to efficiently identify and categorize shelter animals suitable for rescue training.

Technologies Used

MongoDB: Utilized for flexible storage of shelter animal records due to its capability to handle varied data structures.

Python (PyMongo): Object-oriented CRUD operations were implemented for managing database interactions.

Dash (Plotly): Used for developing an interactive, user-friendly dashboard for visualizing animal data.

Jupyter Notebook: Facilitated rapid prototyping and interactive testing of the dashboard functionalities.

Features

CRUD Operations: Implemented using Python class methods (create, read, update, delete) for effective data manipulation in MongoDB.

Interactive Dashboard: Displays animal data in real-time, providing tools such as dynamic filtering, visualization through responsive bar charts, and interactive data tables.

Flexible Data Queries: Offers functionality to filter animal records based on various criteria such as breed and rescue type.
